gedit ~/.gazebo/models/my_robot/model.sdf

gazebo --verbose ../velodyne.world

./vel 4

gz topic -v /gazebo/default/pose/info

python3 server-to-gcc.py

dont forget to make clean and cmake every time there is a new version of gazebo or on a new pc.

gazebo self-installs with:
curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh

also the my_robot folder needs to go into .gazebo/models/
also update setenv to point to the local git folder

#to run the full stack (mostly in order):
gazebo --verbose ../velodyne.world
python3 simulatedPathDrive.py 
python3 driver-to-gazebo.py
./vel 4
